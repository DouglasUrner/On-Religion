The thing we call "god" is the impulse that most, maybe even, all humans feel to be good and decent people – to be "human." This impluse can conflict with other, equally human, impulses: acceptance, security, etc.. Religion is the social / communal effort to nurture god and to navigate the competition between impulses. The "god impulse" has, in Darwinian terms, "survival value." Groups of people with an effective religion tend to be successful.

Religion is a system for monitoring the functioning of the often buggy threads of exection in the odd and poorly understood machines we call "humans" – a "superviosory process" if you will. It is subject to, and benefits from, the analytical methods that are applied to complex software systems that run on the machines we calls "computers."

We can analyze both the design and the security of religions. We can develop tests for them (and for the other "processes" that we run to guide human society).

Deities make sense and are ***huge*** bugs.

Without deities specs and testing are possible.
