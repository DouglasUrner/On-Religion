The thing we call "god" is the impulse that most, maybe even, all humans feel to be good and decent people – to be "human." This impluse can conflict with other, equally human, impulses: acceptance, security, etc.. Religion is the social / communal effort to nurture god and to navigate the competition between impulses. The "god impulse" has, in Darwinian terms, "survival value." Groups of people with an effective religion tend to be successful.

Religion is a system for monitoring the functioning of the often buggy threads of exection in the odd and poorly understood machines we call "humans" – a "superviosory process" if you will. It is subject to, and benefits from, the analytical methods that are applied to complex software systems that run on the machines we calls "computers."

We can analyze both the design and the security of religions. We can develop tests for them (and for the other "processes" that we run to guide human society).

Deities make sense and are ***huge*** bugs.

Without deities specs and testing are possible.

*religion* (n): a social structure established to understand and encourage adherence to god.

It is easier to obtain compliance when you have an external authority and harsh penalites (hell, shunning). Personal responsibility is more "flexible."

An omnipotenet authority, or an infalible one, simplfies the problem further – but it also introduces very serious risks. Humans are neither omnipotent, nor infaliable, so any such construct requires a "superior being" (what many refer to a a "god"). This require magical thinking or, at the very least, the acceptance of a mystery or an onknowable. This can lead to a class of intermediaries with the omnipotent one and that gives rise to the potential for fraud, manipulation, confused motives, and mistaking mental illness for a devine connection.

According to Nicholas Cristakis religososity increases in times of fear and crisis (e.g., during a pandemic). He's probably describing an observed engagement with churches and other religious structures as people seek guidance for how to be a good person in difficult times. People are probably seeking both absolution for not living up to their standards of compassion and also for insight into what "good personship" looks like in new and challenging circumstances.

Cristakis conflates "religion" with adherence to moral authority – seeking outside direction for what to do in the ethical/moral/compassionate spheres of our lives.
