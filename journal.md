At birth, it may usually be possible to asign a reproductive role (aka sex), but asigning, even broadly, a child their role in society – even in the broadest of terms (aka gender) is an act of tremendous arrogance. We have made tremendous strides over the last 50 or 100 years in seeing the tremendous overlaps in gender roles, or maybe we're even starting to see the declining relevance of those roles – at the same time the roles persist in the siliest and most persistant of ways. We seem to be defining the genders less in terms of interesting intrinsics and more and more in oposition to each other.

What becomes of those whose bodies betray them and will not let thim live in comfortable androdyny or who want to fully inhabit the space that had previously been "reserved" for the "oposite" gender – but whose bodies are shaped by the workings of a sex that does not align with their gender? I imagine this would be hard in the most enligtened of societies, but today it is beyond hard. For some it is dangerous. For some it is deadly.

How do you test god/religion? What are the risks of being wrong? Is it right/moral/ethical/in keeping with your faith to hurt others? To hurt others if they are disobeying god? What are the consequences if you are wrong in your interpretation of how someone is living their life?

Does what you do in this life matter? 

How do you separate devine guidance from personal bias? Have you ever mistaken/conflated the two? Has anyone you know? Has any leader of the faith? If not, how is that possible? If so, and you feel entitled to pass judgement, then the first question is critical.

*religion* (n): a social structure established to understand and encourage adherence to god.

It is easier to obtain compliance when you have an external authority and harsh penalites (hell, shunning). Personal responsibility is more "flexible."

An omnipotenet authority, or an infalible one, simplfies the problem further – but it also introduces very serious risks. Humans are neither omnipotent, nor infaliable, so any such construct requires a "superior being" (what many refer to a a "god"). This require magical thinking or, at the very least, the acceptance of a mystery or an onknowable. This can lead to a class of intermediaries with the omnipotent one and that gives rise to the potential for fraud, manipulation, confused motives, and mistaking mental illness for a devine connection.

According to Nicholas Cristakis religososity increases in times of fear and crisis (e.g., during a pandemic). He's probably describing an observed engagement with churches and other religious structures as people seek guidance for how to be a good person in difficult times. People are probably seeking both absolution for not living up to their standards of compassion and also for insight into what "good personship" looks like in new and challenging circumstances.

Cristakis conflates "religion" with adherence to moral authority – seeking outside direction for what to do in the ethical/moral/compassionate spheres of our lives.

Religion is a system for monitoring the functioning of the often buggy threads of exection in the odd and poorly understood machines we call "humans" – a "superviosory process" if you will. It is subject to, and benefits from, the analytical methods that are applied to complex software systems that run on the machines we calls "computers."

We can analyze both the design and the security of religions. We can develop tests for them (and for the other "processes" that we run to guide human society).

Deities make sense and are ***huge*** bugs.

Without deities specs and testing are possible.

The thing we call "god" is the impulse that most, maybe even, all humans feel to be good and decent people – to be "human." This impluse can conflict with other, equally human, impulses: acceptance, security, etc.. Religion is the social / communal effort to nurture god and to navigate the competition between impulses. The "god impulse" has, in Darwinian terms, "survival value." Groups of people with an effective religion tend to be successful.
