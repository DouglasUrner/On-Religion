Religion is a system for monitoring the functioning of the often buggy threads of exection in the odd and poorly understood machines we call "humans" – a "superviosory process" if you will. It is subject to, and benefits from, the analytical methods that are applied to complex software systems that run on the machines we calls "computers."

We can analyze both the design and the security of religions. We can develop tests for them (and for the other "processes" that we run to guide human society).
