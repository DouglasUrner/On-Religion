# Impact, Intent, and Response

>My intent wasn't racist...

## Impact

Your impact on others is how you'll be judged. If your actions sustain systems of oppression you *are* an agent of oppression. Your actions in that moment *are* racist, or sexist, or homophobic, or... If somebody calls you on it, good. You deserve it – the question is if you deserve to be called out because you're a "good" person or because you're a "bad" person. When you hurt someone it should come as no surprise if they tell you about it.

## Intent

Only you have even a glimer of understanding of your intent. You may fervently believe that your intentions were good, that you harbor no malice and...

There is no way for someone on the outside to assess your intent. Those who know you well may feel confident to infer that you "didn't mean it." But even they don't *know*.

From the outside, intent can only be judged by your outward response – what you do when you learn of the impact of your words or deeds. Simply put, if you intent was not to hurt, you will respond.

## Response

Your response will be the measure by which your intent will be judged. There is no need to even discuss intent, start with your best apology, "I'm sorry, thank you for telling me how I impacted you. I'm going to..." Then do it. Search you soul and find a way to (hopefully) avoid the mistake again. It will be work. The negative impact came from somewhere: latentent racism, stereotypes, old "truths" you've never question, patterns of angry behavior – you'll have to find that spot and root it out, literally building new paths in your brain.

If your intent truely was not to hurt. If you're embarrased and pained by the impact of your actions, the work will be worth doing. The one who asked you to be accountable for your impact will start to be respected as a coach.

Don't defend your impact – you're already in a hole, stop digging. Listen and learn. Can you mirror back what happened that was hurtful (**not** do you agree with it, just can you restate it clearly and accurately)? You don't get to "agree" or "disagree" with another person's perception of your impact - you just get to seek to understand what you did, why you did it, and if you want to change.

## But...

I'm writing this as a cis white man – from a very comfortable postion – my interest is in not abusing my privilage. When I try to apply this framework to a person of less privilage being told be someone with more privilage and power that their impact was wrong I'm not sure this works.
