# How to be useful when it's not "your" fight

First, it's only "not your fight" in the sense that you have less "skin in the game." An injury to one is most assuradly an injury to all and we are all impacted by oppression – sometimes in ways we see, and often in ways that we don't see. That said, those of us with some privilage and who aren't face with a day-to-day struggle to survive in a particular domain, do better when we listen and learn when to step back and let those with "no choice" lead and learn from them.

I come to this primarily from trying to be an ally to LGBTQ folk

For many of us it may be hard to be "all in" – we have the privilage of not *having* to confront oppression – so we get to choose when and which battles to fight. That can make us suspect, we can "pass," we can run and hide, we can be "too busy."

* Know why you are an ally - why are you in this fight? How does *your* life be better when their lives get better? What is in it for you? If you look honestly at it, some of your reasons may be kind of *weird* – that's ok, reflect on it, learn as much as you can and recognize that we're all a mess…

* Do your homework - as you work at being an ally, put your own energy into understanding the struggles of the folks you're trying to support. Learn from *them* but don't expect them to teach *you.*

* Be confusing - talk about your own life without "leading" with your gender or sexual orientation

* Use your privilage

* Normalize - use neutral pronouns as the default; add your pronouns to your signature blocks and Zoom names; ask to have your pronouns added to your business cards.

* Take care of your own - when you're in spaces where "your" people aren't seeing others or are making a space less than welcoming, stick your neck out. Don't leave it to your allies to be the first to speak up.

* Know that you'll make some serious "beginner mistakes" - they will feel awful, they will be humiliating, you'll want to give up. You might even get angry and want to "lash back" at your allies. It's messy, it can get ugly, it's normal. Expect it so that when it happens you'll be (sort of) prepared and (a bit more) able to "get back up on the horse." This is a long game.

* Assume that some of the "corrections" for your mistakes will make your allies really angry at you. That will really feel awful. When it happens, shut up and listen, in the meantime remember that you're *only* in this position because you're trying to do the right thing and that you're doing it boldy enough to screw up and get noticed. It's not good to screw up and it really sucks to get called on it, especially when you're getting called out by the folks who you thought you were supporting.

* Notice when you feel "hemmed in" – I still remember being about 6 or 8 and having my babysitter talk about her "girlfriends" – it sounded so nice to have someone that special, **and** I knew, even at that age and with *zero* experionce of LGBTQ people, not even the idea that such people existed, that as a "man-to-be" that my best male friend **could not** be my "boyfriend." How are you forced to conform? How do you force yourself to conform? How does sexism, and racism, and homophobia, and transphobia, and all of the other fearful and hateful behaviors that "don't apply" to you actually limit and lessen you?

* In the parts of the world where you have power make it easier and more comfortable for everyone. Reduce the emotional and spritual cost of dealing with your office by not having a binary choice for genders.
